      Kottayam is a beautiful city located in Kerala. The city is known for its rich natural beauty with lakes and paddy fields. Located close to the Western Ghats, Kottayam sits in the lap of nature, away from the hustle and bustle of big cities. This peaceful place has a lot of treats for travel enthusiasts and tourists looking for peaceful adventure. 
      The island of Pathiramanal is popular among tourist places in Kottayam and located only 26 km away. This island offers a spectacular view of a lake that stretches as far as the eyes go. Bereft of dense population, the island’s serenity and surroundings are unmatched. The island itself holds densely wooded areas with rare trees and plants.
      Kottathavalam is a beautiful cave carved out of rock near Kottayam. This cave is located 70 km away from Kottayam within the Murugan Hills at Kurisumala. The cave is said to be the resting place of the Madura Royal family. The cave is a sight to see because of its rich carvings of sculptures of Gods, Goddesses, weapons, and goods.
      The Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary or Vembanad Bird Sanctuary is a major Kottayam tourist place just 15 km away from the city centre. Bird-watching enthusiasts will find this place truly magical. The sanctuary takes you through the banks of the Vembanad Lake, which can be navigated by boat.
